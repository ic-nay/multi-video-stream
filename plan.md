I want to:
- Take in a directory of videos
- Use FFmpeg to set up an RTSP stream for every video
- Use MediaMTX to host all of those streams
- Use FFmpeg to test each of those streams


Forget GIUs, this has to be done yesterday. It will take a directory of videos as a command-line argument. 

TODO (ranked by priority):
1. Add option to specify paths to mediamtx and ffmpeg binaries
2. Double-check tools are correctly installed and available before attempting to use
3. Help menu
4. Verbosity
